# Welcome to Ona!

([Ona (formerly Gitpod)](https://ona.com/stories/gitpod-is-now-ona)) is the mission control for your personal team of software engineering agents working across the entire software development lifecycle. Ona is sandboxed for high-autonomy, runs full VS Code in the browser, and also works on your phone.

Ona's platform is compromised of Ona Agents, Ona Environments, and Ona Guardrails. 

**Ona Agents**: professional software engineering agents that execute tasks in parallel, or autonomously in the background, with the full context of your environments. 

**Ona Environments**: ephemeral, isolated workspaces. Configured to include source code, dependencies, tools, and access policies. Can run in Onaâ€™s managed cloud or in your own infrastructure.

**Ona Guardrails**: security and compliance features, inncluding network controls, identity integration (OIDC), audit logs, and policy enforcement.
