# 👋 Welcome to Gitpod!

Gitpod’s developer platform provides on-demand cloud development environments ([CDEs](https://www.gitpod.io/cde)) to create software faster and more securely. CDEs are pre-configured with all tools, libraries and dependencies needed to write, test and review code. They can be easily duplicated and shared across teams.
