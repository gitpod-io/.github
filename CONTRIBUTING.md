# Contributing to Gitpod

Gitpod is developed as an open core product under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod), making the majority of functionality freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. As is typical with open core enterprise features are developed under a non OSI-approved license. Where contributions are not trivial ("de minimis") Gitpod requires contributors to sign a contributors license agreement before we will be able to merge your contribution.

 Gitpod has built-in the open for the last decade. Transparency is key and as a company Gitpod strives to be as open about as many things as possible. This refers to both developing Gitpod in the open (public issues, public roadmap, public milestones) as well as how employees interact on a personal level with other human beings. Gitpodders are strong believers in the benefits that an open culture provides. At Gitpod we are open-minded, inclusive, transparent, and curious. We always remain students of the game, not masters of the game.
